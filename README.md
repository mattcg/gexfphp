# Gexf for PHP #

Graph Exchange XML Format ([GEXF](http://www.gexf.net/format/)) library for PHP. The XML-serialization and deserialization classes are still under heavy development, but the rest of the library is stable and almost fully unit tested.

If you're into pull parsing and StAX, please do contribute.

## Installation ##

```bash
sudo pecl install SPL_Types
cd gexf/
composer install --prefer-dist
```
